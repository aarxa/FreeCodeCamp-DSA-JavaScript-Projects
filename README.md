# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Projects
[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a nonprofit organization helping thousands of people learn to code for free. This respository captures my personal solutions to the responsive web design projects.</br>

## Projects
These projects are made for the freeCodeCamp Responsive JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures (Beta) Certification. The objective was to use HTML and plain CSS in order to build five responsive webpages that fulfill freeCodeCamp's user stories. You can find further information on the projects in the links below.
