# Pokémon Search App

This app will search for Pokémon by name or ID and display the results to the user. The Pokémon data and images are retrieved from https://pokeapi-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/. I coded this a while back while working towards the JavaScript DSA certificate in FreeCodeCamp.

This code is written in:
- ### HTML
- ### CSS
- ### JavaScript

## Demo Image
